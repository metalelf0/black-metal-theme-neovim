# black-metal-theme-neovim

A collection of black-metal themed neovim colorschemes.

## Why?

This is a lua port of `metalelf0/base16-black-metal-scheme`. It's neovim only and has been realized by exporting the original colorschemes with the amazing `mini.colors` plugin by @echasnovski.

## Changelog

- 1.0 - first version: exported schemes + slightly increased commented text brightness
